# F-scale-of-Tornadoes
Predict the magnitude of Tornadoes

The goal of this problem is to predict the magnitude of tornados based on the F-scale rating (F0 to F9). While there exists a clear description of the F-scale methodology, it will be interesting to see how the different classification algorithms stack up against the defined metric.
